The area is known for its annual Lego World Cup, where teams of people in orange shirts gather to showcase their creations and compete against one another. This year's event was particularly special, as it coincided with the Lego Robotica exhibition, featuring impressive displays of Lego-built robots.

As people explored the event, they couldn't help but be drawn to the Lego City exhibition, where intricate models of cities and buildings were on display. The crowd was amazed by the attention to detail and the sheer creativity of the displays. For those looking for something a bit more adventurous, the event also featured a Lego Train Set exhibition, complete with a miniature train and track.

But the fun didn't stop there. San Giuliano Terme was also home to a Lego Building competition, where participants could show off their skills and creativity by building their own Lego structures. The crowd was wowed by the incredible designs and the sheer talent on display.
